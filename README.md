Customer Churn Analysis with Python
This repository contains a hands-on data science project where we perform data visualization and analysis on customer churn data using Python. The goal is to explore the patterns and insights that can help in understanding customer churn behavior. The project leverages Python's popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for effective data analysis and visualization.

Project Overview
Customer churn refers to the process where customers stop doing business with a company. For companies, minimizing churn is crucial to retain customers and increase profitability. In this project, we explore various visualizations to:

Understand the distribution of churned vs non-churned customers.
Analyze the relationship between tenure and total charges.
Investigate churn patterns across different cities.
Study the distribution of tenure for customers who churned and those who did not.
The insights obtained from these visualizations help to identify potential factors influencing customer churn and guide business decisions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found here.

Key features in the dataset include:

Churn: Indicates whether the customer churned or not.
TenureMonths: The number of months the customer has been with the company.
TotalCharges: The total amount of money charged to the customer.
City: The city in which the customer resides.

Usage
You can view and run the notebook directly on Google Colab using the following link: Google Colab Notebook.

Alternatively, you can run it locally:

Open the Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or Colab.
Ensure the dataset is available in the data/ folder.
Run the cells sequentially to generate the visualizations and insights.
