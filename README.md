# Customer Churn Analysis with Python

This repository contains a hands-on data science project where we perform data visualization and analysis on customer churn data using Python. The goal is to explore the patterns and insights that can help in understanding customer churn behavior. The project leverages Python's popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for effective data analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview
Customer churn refers to the process where customers stop doing business with a company. For companies, minimizing churn is crucial to retain customers and increase profitability. In this project, we explore various visualizations to:
- Understand the distribution of churned vs non-churned customers.
- Analyze the relationship between tenure and total charges.
- Investigate churn patterns across different cities.
- Study the distribution of tenure for customers who churned and those who did not.us.

The insights obtained from these visualizations help to identify potential factors influencing customer churn and guide business decisions.

### Key Features:
- **Churn**: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).
- **TenureMonths**: The number of months the customer has stayed with the company.
- **TotalCharges**: The total amount billed to the customer.
- **City**: The city where the customer resides.
